# Project Soap

Project soap is an open source command line program that removes expletives from media with audio. Powered by Vosk.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/lightningpwr28/project-soap/releases)
2. Run ``project-soap get-model --large``, or download another model from [Alpha Cephei](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models) or elsewhere

## Usage
I recommend using this tool in conjunction with [Stacher](https://stacher.io/) and it's custom post-processing feature - simply add ``project-soap {}`` to a new line!
