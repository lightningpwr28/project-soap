# WhisperX - Local

This file lists installation and usage instructions for using the `whisper-x-local` backend.

## Installation

Right now, installing WhisperX is a little bit of a mess. I hope to automate it in a future release.

### Requirements

WhisperX requires the NVIDIA libraries cuBLAS 11.x and cuDNN 8.x, and, of course, Python 3.10 (likely miniconda as well).

### Steps

Follow the directions listed on [WhisperX's github page.](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX/tree/main).
